    *   This program will make a gameboard for mancala with sausages in place of marbels. (spelling error)
    *   A object for each "home" and for each "table" will have a number of sausages assigned too it that will be displayed as number until we start prettying up the code. 
    *   Every three turns we need one of the cards from our deck (linked above), for each players THIRD turn.
